# Water-Disparity-and-Levee-Management
This project uses LiDAR and Photogrammetry data for levee managmeent

An essential aspect of large rivers is the human need to control them. Installing levees is one way that society has tried to control flooding on large rivers. As levees age, they need to be managed and upkept. In areas where levees are managed by different groups, instances of inconsistent management can sometimes lead to nearby levees being updated while others are forgotten. One case of inconsistent management, and a subsequent levee failure, is the Len Small Levee on the Mississippi River, just north of itâ€™s confluence with the Ohio River in a stretch of river known as the Dogtooth Bend. The Len Small Levee is a farmer-owned levee currently being eroded by the Mississippi River as it forms a chute across farm lands. Now, residents living in the area must travel by boat if they wish to leave the newly formed island.
